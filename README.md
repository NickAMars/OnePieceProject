<h1>Working on a One Piece website.</h1>

I didn't intend for this project to be about one piece but I start with the header and was looking for something I love and found a one piece vector image so yeah that where it started. I'm going to use all my CSS and HTML knowledge on this project. I might just throw in JQuery for which functionality but my main front end frame work is react. so I will be changing some functionalities later on as this project progress. I also put in a back end such as node.js because i do want to work on my node js skill.
  This is going to be fun.

Media querys for info section

Media querys which I will apply to the intro section is the
movement of its grid.
So im thinking to make the two sunny summery at the top and pull the image and the video in horizantal format
if therer is any more propments i might just have to increase the row and
make a new section for the video and images in the order 1 ,2,3.



Took three half hours added the media query to the introduction to the sunny.
Tomorrow i think i am going to work on the footer of the page.



Finish footer section. was easy just needed to create a 2 grid and use space between and everything would be responsive with the screen.

So next task is to make the images responsive as well.

Then after that i will work on the decoration of the site trying to see if i can make it a little bit better than it is now.


Trying to think about different things i can do to the site that would make people use it.
