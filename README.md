<h1>Working on a One Piece website.</h1>

I didn't intend for this project to be about one piece but I start with the header and was looking for something I love and found a one piece vector image so yeah that where it started. I'm going to use all my CSS and HTML knowledge on this project. I might just throw in JQuery for which functionality but my main front end frame work is react. so I will be changing some functionalities later on as this project progress. I also put in a back end such as node.js because i do want to work on my node js skill.
  This is going to be fun.




If I want to use a gifs here it is.
GIPHY is the perfect place:
